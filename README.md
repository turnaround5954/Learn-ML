# Learn-ML

I found it's hard to finish training cs224 assignment5's NMT on my own laptop.
I also found that one can use GPU free on kaggle.
Something wrong happened when uploading my code to a kaggle kernel directly,
so I created this repository and use git clone to get my code :D

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will also upload some other homework related things here for a backup.
If it happens to be useful to you, I will be happy to hear that :D

btw. let me know if you find bugs in my code (or my english as well) XD
